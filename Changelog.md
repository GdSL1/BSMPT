2018/06/25 : Fixed a mistake in eq (2.30) in the manual and the corresponding formula in the code. Thanks to Peter Athron for noticing this. Additionally the numbers of minimizations was increased if only the GSL minimizer is used. Before it searched for 20 local minima, now it searches for 50. 
2018/04/23 : Fixed a wrong sign in the yukawa couplings to the CP-odd higgs fields
2018/03/30 : Corrected a small bug in the minimizer which caused a seg fault if vevsolTmp > 0.5 and ModifiedVEVVectorDim has dimension 0
2018/03/07 : v1.0 : Relase
